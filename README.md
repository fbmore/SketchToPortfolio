# SketchToPortfolio
Drag Sketch Artboards to your Free&amp;Willing public feed or to a private collection of yours. Works with PNGs and JPGs as well.

# Installation
Download, unzip and double click "SketchToPortfolio.sketchplugin"

# Usage
1) Launch the plugin: Plugins > SketchToPortfolio > Upload To Free&Willing (Cmd + Control + u)
2) Log into your Free&Willing account (create a profile first at http://FreeAndWilling.com/)
3) Drag Artboards from your list (not the canvas) in your Sketch file into the drop area.

You can also drag PNGs and JPGs from your desktop :)

# Tips:
- If you organize your images into a collection you have more control on the privacy as the images won't appear in your public feed but will be visible when sharing the collection's URL.
- You can change the visibility of each image after upload too if you want
- Adding tags to the artboard (or filename) will add tags to your post
-- For example the Artboard called "Mobile Home Screen #mobile #app #UIDesign" (same thing for PNGs or JPGs "Mobile Home Screen #mobile #app #UIDesign.png")
